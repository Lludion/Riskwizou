### Play the game

Each player begins with 3 units, a cavalier, a cannon and a soldier, in a chosen zone (random at the moment).

At each beginning of a turn (except the first one), it will receive 2 points to get units. (currently, it can buy either 2 soldiers, 1 cavalier or 1 cannon)

Units can move as much as their movement points (pm) allow it. If a unit is present in the zone you wish to move into, it will be attacked; one can only attack with up to 3 untis at a time (and defend with up to 2 units).
